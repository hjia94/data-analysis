# analysis
 Data analysis repo for everything. Created on Feb.2024 with the aim to include all data analysis routine in one repository.
 
 This repository will include all old data analysis functions from Bdot_analysis, LP_analysis, and hairpin_analysis. The aim is to not have duplicate code for each analysis routine that does the same thing. Old functions that work for generic cases will be included, and updated with improvement.
 
 For each experiment performed on a different machine, a new branch will be created accordingly with specific analysis routine.
